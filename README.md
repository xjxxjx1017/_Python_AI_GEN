This is a auto testing tool for game developers. It automatically test and suggest best configurations for games.

### Current Flow
1. A console pops up
2. The user types in a command
3. The console runs the "Survival Game" simulation with randomly generated configuration for multiple times
4. The console give out a summary, a list of reports
5. The user can type in an integer to check details of a report and the configuration that runs the simulation
6. Go back to step 2

### Upcoming Development
````
* A1    A super fast, instant game, legendary fighter
* A3    Show data in pixel colors!	A reports for all generations.
* A2    A real simulation game, game is not instant, shooting

* B2    Modelize - auto parameter tester
* B4    PixelGraphic mode for command input XD, for hacking

* B1    time limit, or cycle limit, 100ms - break & give results
* B1    normal distribution
* B1    Parameters range/mid report ! with weight !
